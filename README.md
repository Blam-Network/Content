# Sunrise-Content [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/sbtkbnvywwmi715u?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/craftycodie/sunrise-content)

This repository contains title storage content used for the Sunrise project.
This content includes matchmaking playlists, game sets, MOTDs and more.
The title-storage content within this repo is not what Halo reads, and it's not what would have been on the Halo servers. Instead you will find JSON configuration files, which the Sunrise BLF Tool is capable of reading and converting to the BLF files which the game can use.

## Credits

- @GameCheat13 Provided a mostly complete backup of halo 3's title storage prior to the shutdown.
- Various members of The Original Halo 3 Discord made preservation efforts and were able to provide some of the missing map/game variants.
